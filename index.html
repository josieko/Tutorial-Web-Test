        <h1>🪸 Welcome to the HTML & CSS Deep Dive 🐠</h1> 
        <h2>Let's dive in! 🏊🏻‍♂️</h2>

        <h3>HTML aka the 🦴</h3> 

        <div class="flex-container">
            <p>
                <h4><u>What is it</u></h4> 
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is a (HyperText) Markup language that is not really considered a coding language.</li>
                    <li>Used to structure webpage content, as the skeleton, it defines how the elements should be displayed.</li>
                    <li>It is best known for the &lt;&gt; brackets that are used to define HTML elements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>What is it good for</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s good for creating web page structures, email templates, and online forms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>What is it not good for</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s not good for styling web pages; that’s where CSS comes in, and the same thing with interactivity, where JavaScript is used to fill that gap.</li>
                    <li>HTML was intended to be a simple markup language with a focus on structuring and presenting content. The simplicity of it is both a strength (for it being simple and accessible) and a weakness in terms of it not having capabilities for more complex tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Who uses it</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s a widely spread language that anyone can use to create a web page, from professional web devs, content creators, and bloggers, or it could be for a hobby.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Companies that implement it</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any company, business, or individual having a website uses HTML, so it is pretty much a base for it all.</li>
                    <li>Everyone uses it, from Google, Amazon, and Apple to Netflix, Spotify, Wikipedia, and the list goes on.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Cool TikTok finds and tools</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://html5up.net">🐚 HTML5up</a> - Website with free downloadable templates.</li>
                    <li>Emmet (integrated in VS Code) allows you to be faster by typing just the name of the element, by typing enter you get the opening and closing tags without manually writing them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Fun facts</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is the oldest markup language on the web and it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who invented WWW.</li>
                    <li>The world’s first web page was written in it.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>CSS aka the 👘</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <p>
                <h4><u>What is it</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to style and describe how the website will be presented. That includes colors, fonts, and layouts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>What is it good for</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s good to style and control the look of the page, including controlling the layout of the page, the appearance of text, images, links, and other elements like tables, forms, or buttons.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>What is it not good for</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Like HTML, CSS is used in combination with other languages to complement them and isn’t good for defining the structure of the page or interactivity. This is because it is primarily a styling language, not designed to handle complexities such as data manipulation or interactivity.</li>
                    <li>CSS can struggle with extremely complex animations; in such cases, specialized libraries like GSAP, Anime.js, or WebGL libraries come in handy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Who uses it</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just like HTML, anyone who makes or has a website, business or individual, will use CSS to style the appearance of their website.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Cool TikTok finds and tools</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://neumorphism.io">🦪 Neuomorphism</a> - Website used to generate CSS code for buttons, physical objects, or materials.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php">🪸 W3Schools CSS elements list</a> - Website containing all the elements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Fun facts</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first CSS property was font-family.</li>
                    <li>It was first introduced in 1996.</li>
                </ul>
